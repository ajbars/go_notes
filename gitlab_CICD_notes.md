ifkonfig command gets ip addresses from the terminal

oh my zsh has very useful kubectl abbreviations. It has to be install on top of the zsh terminal, which is similar to bash

echo "chassis" > car.txt  // Replaces what was in the file with "chassis"<br>
echo "chassis" >> car.txt // Appends "chassis" to what is already there <br>
grep "chassis" car.txt    // Searches for "chassis" inside car.txt <br>
