Microsoft Devops Challenge Lessons

1. OODA loop: observe, orient, decide, act. This was invented to keep fighter pilots from being shot out of the sky

Observe business, market, needs, current user behaviour and telemetry data
Orient with the enumeration of options for what you can deliver, perhaps with experiments
Decide what to pursue
Act by delivering working software to users

Become data informed - use data to inform what to do in next cycle
1/3 of deployments bring negative results, 1/3 neutral and 1/3 good. Double down on good, fail fast on the ones that don't advance the business. 'Pivot or persevere' approach.

Shorten your cycle time
You shorten your cycle time by working in smaller batches
Using more automation
Hardening your release pipeline
Improving your telemetry
Deploying more frequently

More frequent deployment = more experimenting. This acceleration in validated learning is the value of the improvement. 

The goal is to shorten the cycle. Start with the release pipeline. How long does it take to deploy a line of code? That is a brake on your velocity.
Continuous integration drives the ongoing merging and testing of code, leading to an early finding of defects + less time fighting merge issues and rapid feedback for devs
Continuous Delivery of software solutions to prod and test environments helps quickly fix bugs and respond to changing business requirements
Integrate Version Control with software development tools for monitoring deployments
A Devops Definition of Done is a working software collecting telemetry againts the intended business goals
Monitoring and logging of running applications. Helps create a hypothesis and quickly validate/disprove strategies

DevOps may hurt at first. If it hurts, do it more often
Cross-train to develop synergy


Explore shared goals
Goals should include numbers
Reduce the time spent on fixing bugs by 60%
Reduce the time spent on unplanned work by 70%
Reduce the out-of-hours work required by staff to no more than 10% working time
Define timelines for goals
Have an ongoing series of short-time goals
Every few weeks improvements should be clear and measurable
Short plans allow: 
easier changing of plans/priorities
reduced delay between work and feedback
easier to keep organizational support
